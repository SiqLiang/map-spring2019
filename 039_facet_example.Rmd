Full disclosure.  The actual code was produced on the garbage-spaghetti plan.  The quality of the code is not something I'm proud of.  Therefore, I sanitized the code by showing the example,  above.  All the [actual code is available](038_facets_wrap_thematic_mapping.html).  You can explore and/or reproduce this process from the actual code, as you see fit.  If you don't mind, rewrite the code, using `purrr` then send me a cleaned and literate version.  'prec.
